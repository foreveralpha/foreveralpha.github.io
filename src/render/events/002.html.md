Schillerpromenade 4. 12049 Berlin  
An evening to get together and discuss the future(s) of biohacking spaces in Berlin.

After the first social in mid-April, featuring the Biohacking book launch, this second gathering will give us a chance for introductions, to get know where everyone's coming from and discuss what biohacking events we'd like to see happen in the future.

Now that the kitchenlab had its debut in Stockholm, and the [Biotinkering Berlin association](http://www.meetup.com/Biotinkering-Berlin/?a=pswmg2) has plans for a space in Wedding, there will be many plans to hatch over soup and slides by Axel D. Reinert.

The event will also coincide with the [Human Traces â€“ Marcos Vidal Font & Wai Kit Lam](http://www.top-ev.de/schillerpalais/human-traces-marcos-vidal-font-wai-kit-lam/) exhibition currently on view at Schillerpalais.
