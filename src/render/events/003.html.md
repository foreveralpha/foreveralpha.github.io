## Machine Copy: A PCR Workshop ##
10h-19h 12 August and 9h-19h 13 August 2016  
[Schillerpalais](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3043349524)  
Schillerpromenade 4. 12049 Berlin  
Join us this Friday and Saturday for the next Forever Alpha meetup: a workshop on DIY machinery for biolabs. While attendance is limited, the PCR machine constructed during the workshop will be available for further public use in the developing biohacking [kitchenlab](http://www.top-ev.de/kitchenlab/) at Schillerpalais.

### Workshop Description ### 
At the beginning of the 20th century, we were beginning to use code to handle machines. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, we are using machines to alter genetic code. The aim of the workshop is to investigate methods to explore, multiply and prepare DNA for analysis through self-made devices.

The daily sessions will focus on building your own [PCR Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_cycler), a common piece of biolab equipment used to amplify segments of DNA, and a gel chamber for electrophoresis. Using an Arduino as a base design and Python for programming the machine, the DIY machine opens avenues for conceptual implementation of biohacking projects.

The workshop is open to beginner and experienced bio-intrepids alike.

***Recommended donation of €20 per person. Given the short-notice nature of the workshop, there will be future events using the PCR machine, and for which a donation is not requested.***

### Schedule ###
Please view the two-day schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KsvlKRMHrYDuPyoyp_j3YgfMOm6icI3NSqVgNPtBCnM/edit?usp=sharing).

IMPORTANT: The workshop will take place over the course of two days, from 10h─19h on Friday 12 August and 9h─19h on Saturday 13 August. While it is short notice, preference may be given to those who can attend both days of the workshop. **Please see the link at the bottom of this post to reserve your space**, and comment on the meetup with your availability if it is less than the full schedule of the workshop. We'll do our best to accommodate everyone!
